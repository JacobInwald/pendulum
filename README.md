# Pendulum

## Introduction
A foray into genetic algorithms.
I wrote a quick pendulum balancing game, and then wrote a neural network that tried to get highscores in it. 
This was trained with a genetic algorithm
Running this is more of a demo of 

## Installation
1. Install all the requirements from the requirements.txt
2. To play the game yourself, you can run `python game.py`
3. To see the genetic algorithm learn, you can run `python trainer.py`. If you want to edit the variables such as `gen_size`, go into the `trainer.py` and fiddle all you want.
  a. Clicking on the window will spawn your mouse cursor as a box with collision if you want to mess around with the networks.

## Misc
Report any other errors under issues, and I may or may not get onto to solving it.

Enjoy!!!
